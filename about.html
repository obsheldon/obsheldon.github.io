                    <p>At Erickson Design Associates teamwork is everything. We do partner with architects, furniture makers, window treatment workrooms, construction and clients. Our project teams adapt to the scope and size of our projects. A consultation will be with Julie and a full house rehab will have Julie who understand construction, project management and the full decorative scope as well as a construction manager. With a range of experience Julie can go from small to big projects with ease. This diversity helps meet the needs of our projects in the best ways possible. One of the best things about our building is thatâ€™s its dog friendly. On any given day the team is rounded out by our furry friends.</p>
