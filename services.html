                </div>

                <div id="about_fsi">
                    <p>Our interior design services have a broad range. Sometimes our clients need just a consultation for new ideas or paint colors or they may have a few rooms needing to be refurnished; other times they have a full scale remodel. We tailor our expertise to meet the requests of our clients. Over the years we have enjoyed keeping our project size varied and our visions flexible.

                        Our design services always start with space planning; creating new ideas on how you can use your home through visuals, furniture planning and architectural ideas when needed. Once these ideas and plans are reviewed by our clients we create design concepts that are reflective of our client’s life style and budget.

                        Understanding style and color palettes are our most important design emphasis. To us it’s just as important to know how to mix subtle shades of grey and silver as it is to combine a bright and energizing palette. We enjoy understanding how to design furniture, fabrics, lighting, art and accessories in ways that generate the look and feel our clients love.

                        For our team it’s not just about the end result, that pretty picture, but the design process and the client relationship that mean the most to Erickson Design Associates.</p>

                    <h2> Full Architectural Renovation Services</h2>
                </div>

                <div id="about_full">
                    <p>As in our interior design practice our interior architectural work is comprehensive.

                        We work with architects and contractors to fully detail the interiors of our clients homes. It’s important to us to have the interior architecture and the interior design be as seamless as possible. Teamwork and planning are the key to this vision. We always think ahead to envision how the spacing planning, furniture lay-out and every day family ergonomics can impact a space before the walls are even constructed.

                        We work together with your construction team to provide the best design vision. This encompasses: drawings and specifications for kitchens, bathrooms, molding packages, built-in cabinetry, lighting plans and hard materials such as flooring, tile, stone and glass.

                        Our ability to work from the studs up, mean a dedication to the details of our projects. As interior designers we believe the interior architecture of a space should be as interesting as the colors, fabrics and furnishings, which takes teamwork and a broader design vision.</p>

                    <h2>Custom Furniture Design</h2>
                </div>

                <div id="about_custom">
                    <p>When you need to find just the right piece for your space, we can help with custom furniture design. Perhaps you’ve scoured the showrooms but have not found what you’re looking for, or maybe you want something unique. Custom furniture is not necessarily more expensive than ready-made, but it is of exceptionally high-quality and made just for you. We work with you to understand your style, review inspirational photos and sketches, and finalize the design. We then partner with highly-experienced craftsmen and women to fabricate the piece. In the end, you have furniture that is beautiful, functional, and unique.
